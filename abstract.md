# MDAKits: A Framework for Robust and Accessible Molecular Simulation Analysis

## Abstract

The reproducibility and transparency of scientific findings are widely recognized as crucial for promoting scientific progress.
However, when it comes to scientific software, researchers face many barriers and few incentives to ensure that their software is open to the community, thoroughly tested, and easily accessible.
To address this issue, the "MDAKits" framework has been developed, which simplifies the process of creating robust toolkits for the MDAnalysis simulation analysis package https://mdanalysis,org.
The framework achieves this by providing a cookiecutter template, boilerplate testing workflows, and an MDAKit registry.
